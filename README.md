# QR Continue

A minimal browser extension that generates a QR Code linking
to the current web page.

## Motivation

A friend gave me the idea for this extension as he wanted
to continue viewing links on his phone that he had opened
on his PC, but he preferred to use different browsers on his
phone and desktop (Safari on iPhone and Firefox on his PC).

So I came up with this very simple extension that uses
the [qrcode.js](https://github.com/soldair/node-qrcode) CDN
to generate a QR code for the current page.
